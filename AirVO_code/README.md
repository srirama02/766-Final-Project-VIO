## AirVO

A lot of progress was done with converting the codebase to use ROS2 from ROS1, however it was not fully finished. There were alot of dependency issues
and the ROS2 conversions was more challenging than expected. The current progress has been pushed to the included submodule and we hope to continue the
progress and eventually finish the conversion. The repo also includes the ROS1 codebase and the associated directions to run it.
